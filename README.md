# Discord_Virus_Checker
A small soft to check if Discord is infected by a virus

As a lot of malwares use Discord to steal credentials and spread, I made a simple software to check if Discord's Core Module hasn't been infected.

The already compiled .exe can be found at https://thryn.fr/apps/DiscordChecker.exe
